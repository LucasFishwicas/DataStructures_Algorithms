This is a repository dedicated to common Data Structures and Algorithms encountered in computer science.

These are written in the low level language C++.

This repository currently contains a programme for Linear- and Binary-Search in Algorithms.cpp.

I intend to add other common algorithms such as Sorting, as well as Data Structures such as Hash Tables, and Linked Lists.
