# Data Structures & Algorithms

This is a repository dedicated to common Data Structures and Algorithms encountered in computer science.

These are written in the low level language C++.

This repository currently contains a programme for Linear- and Binary-Search in Algorithms.cpp.

To-do:
- Algorithms:
    - Bubble-sort
    - Selection-sort
    - Merge-sort
- Data Structures:
    - Linked list
    - Binary tree
    - Hash table


- Contribution:
    - [Luke Fishwick](https://github.com/LucasFishwicas)
        - Done:
            - Added Bubble Sort written in C
            - Refactor Algorithm from C to C++ 
            - Use Bubble Sort in Main (Modified arr to be unsorted)
