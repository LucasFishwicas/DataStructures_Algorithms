    g++ file-path -o exe-name
    e.g., "g++ .\Algorithms.cpp -o Algorithms"
        >> Algorithms.exe



Luke [Mac]:
    g++ file-path -o exe-name
    e.g., "g++ Algorithms.cpp -o TEST"
        >> TEST

    default <exe-name> = a.out
    (In GUI File System, a.out is considered a Document,
        but TEST is considered a Unix Executable
        both run in terminal but a.out fails to open in GUI)
